# Lab 4: EasyQoS and related APIs - Policy Preview<font color='red'> New API in GA 1.3</font>

##### We learned how to create a policy and push it into network device. It will be nice if we can see what will be pushed into network device before create/apply policy. In APIC-EM GA 1.3 we actually can do that. This is one of cool features in 1.3. 

#### Policy comprises the following elements:

* Policy Scope — Group of devices with the same policy tag that will be configured with the policy.

* Applications — Software programs or network signaling protocols that are being used in your network. EasyQoS includes the Cisco Network Based Application Recognition, second generation (NBAR2) application library of approximately 1400 distinct applications and sub-applications. In this session we will create a custom application to be used for creating policy.

* Traffic Classes—Groups of applications that make configuring policies easier, because the groups contain applications that have similar traffic needs.

* Business-relevance—Attribute that classifies a given application according to how relevant it is to your business and operations. The attributes are business relevant, default, and business irrelevant.


## Objectives
Learn how to create a policy preview in a plain text format(IOS config).

These are steps of creating policy by using APIC-EM APIs, these steps apply to Policy preview too.

1. Create Policy Tag
   * POST /policy/tag  
2. Policy scopes - attach policy tags to network devices (where you want EasyQOS to be enabled)
   * POST /policy/tag/association
3. Select application(s) to be used in policy, create custom one if you need to.
   * POST /application
4. <font color='red'>Create Policy preview.</font>
   * POST /policy/preview


The steps and JSON object for creating preview is similar to creating policy with additional two attributes **"networkDeviceIds"** and **"state"**. See the following figure.

![Figure](/posts/files/policy/preview.jpg)

Except a new function **get\_file\_with\_id( )**, all other functions are the same as in create policy script - `lab5-1-post-policy.py` that we will discuss in next session. There are mainly used to provide parameters to populate JSON object for `POST policy/preview`. <br> 
The content of preview will be saved in a file and **get\_file\_with\_id( )** function is used to retrieve file content by using `GET file/{fileId}` API.<br>

#### Source code recap:
1. Ask user to enter a policy name
2. Ask user to select a policy tag
3. Ask user to select an application
4. Create policy preview

* Source code file: lab4-1-policy-preview.py
* To run the python file, execute one of the following commands:<br>

	**Linux** or **Mac OS:**  `python3 lab4-1-policy-preview.py`<br>
	**Windows:**    `py -3 lab4-1-policy-preview.py` or `python lab4-1-policy-preview.py`<br>

##### The following figure shows the response from the ```policy/preview ``` API. 

![Figure](/posts/files/policy/preview_response.jpg)

##### The following code snippet shows how we parse the response from above figure.<br>
* The for loop in line 1 iterates entire "response" attribute. ```preview = response_json["response"]```
* <font color='red'>The for loop in line 2 iterates "policy" attribute</font>
* <font color='blue'>The code in line 3 make sure policy preview is created, we won't see "policyName" if preview is not created.</font>
* <font color='green'>We created many lines of code only for one purpose - to get "fileId". Once we have this id we can use **```GET /file/<id>```** API to retrieve policy preview. We may also get fileId when the status of **```POST policy/preview```** is **```INPROGRESS```** but the preview content maybe incomplete.</font>

**The output of lab4-1-policy-preview.py may look like the following**

### Session Summary ##

This concludes the policy preview lab session. In next lab session we will discuss how to delete Policy Tag, policy Tag Association, Application and Policy after creation.

#### <font color='red'> Note: May not be able to get policy preview in some situations when using DB only sandbox.</font>
If you can not obtain policy preview chance could be that there is a **policy conflict**. If you use the task id return by ```POST policy/preview``` apply to ```GET task/<id>``` API you may find response similar to the following:
