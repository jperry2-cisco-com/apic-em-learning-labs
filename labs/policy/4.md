# Lab 3: EasyQoS and related APIs - Create Custom NBAR2 Application


#### Policy comprises the following elements:

* Policy Scope — Group of devices with the same policy tag that will be configured with the policy.

* <font color='red'>Applications — Software programs or network signaling protocols that are being used in your network. EasyQoS includes the Cisco Network Based Application Recognition, second generation (NBAR2) application library of approximately 1400 distinct applications and sub-applications. In this session we will create a custom application to be used for creating policy.</font>

* Traffic Classes—Groups of applications that make configuring policies easier, because the groups contain applications that have similar traffic needs.

* Business-relevance—Attribute that classifies a given application according to how relevant it is to your business and operations. The attributes are business relevant, default, and business irrelevant


## Objectives
*  Learn how to use the EasyQoS related APIs to create an application.

These are steps of creating policy by using APIC-EM APIs


1. Create Policy Tag
   * POST /policy/tag  
2. Policy scopes - attach policy tags to network devices (where you want EasyQOS to be enabled)
   * POST /policy/tag/association
3. <font color='red'>Select application(s) to be used in policy, create custom one if you need to.</font>
   * POST /application
4. Create and Apply Policy.
   * POST /policy


## Step 3 - Select NBAR2 an application or Create a custom NBAR2 application
We could just select existing application(s) to create policy, but would like to show what minimum information we need to create a custom application.
For more information of NBAR2, see [NBAR2 or Next Generation NBAR](http://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/collateral/ios-nx-os-software/network-based-application-recognition-nbar/qa_c67-697963.html)

Example of JSON object for ```POST /application```.

For more information, see the [APIC-EM API Reference Docs](http://devnetapic.cisco.com/)

```
[{"trafficClass":"BULK_DATA",
  "helpString":testApp,
  "name":testApp,
  "appProtocol": "tcp/udp",
  "udpPorts": "8888",
  "tcpPorts": "8888",
  "pfrThresholdJitter":1,
  "pfrThresholdLossRate":50,
  "pfrThresholdOneWayDelay":500,
  "pfrThresholdJitterPriority":1,
  "pfrThresholdLossRatePriority":2,
  "pfrThresholdOneWayDelayPriority":3,
  "category":"other",
  "subCategory":"other",
  "categoryId":"",
  "longDescription": "custom application",
  "ignoreConflict":True
}]
```

In this sample code we will put this JSON object in a file -  `lab3-1-post-application.json` so we just need to change JSON file to create different application.

#### Source code recap:
1. Load the JSON object for ```POST /application``` API
2.  <font color='red'>Get category id according to category name in JSON object</font>
3. Ask user to enter application name
4. Populate user input to JSON object
5. Execute the POST request

* Source code file: lab3-1-post-application.py
* To run the python file, execute one of the following commands:<br>
	**Linux** or **Mac OS:**  `python3 lab3-1-post-application.py`<br>
	**Windows:**    `py -3 lab3-1-post-application.py` or `python lab3-1-post-application.py`

When you try out this code other than use unique application name you may also want to change other parameters like port number, categoryId to prevent resource conflict.

Executing GET 'https://devnetapi.cisco.com/sandbox/apic_em/api/v1/category'

GET 'category' Status:  200 


Executing POST 'https://devnetapi.cisco.com/sandbox/apic_em/api/v1/application'

POST 'application' Status:  202 

Response:
 {
    "version": "1.0",
    "response": {
        "taskId": "8c42e078-f8c0-42f8-96b9-5f5402cff4fa",

    }
}
```

To check the result we can either check it from UI or use API  ```GET /application``` (see lab3-2-get-custom-application.py). Since APIC-EM includes approximately 1400 distinct applications so it may take a while. But there is filter in ``` GET /application ``` API, if we set parameter ``` {"isCustom":True} ``` in this GET request it should return only custom applications quickly.
