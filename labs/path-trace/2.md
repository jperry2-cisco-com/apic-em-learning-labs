# Lab 1: Host and Task Service APIs

## Objectives
In this session, we will learn:

* What is a **host** ? What can we do with the **host** API?

Like the `network-device` API we explored in the previous session, the `host` API provides a way to get information about network elements; however, the `host` API interacts with `hosts`, rather than with the devices that the `network-device` API manages. Both APIs are commonly used by many applications.

In this session, we'll use the host API to get some host information.

## What does "host" mean to Cisco APIC-EM ?
The network-scanning application classifies each network element that it discovers as a `network-device` or as a `host`. A **network-device** is part of the network traffic-management infrastructure, while a **host** is not part of the traffic-management infrastructure. For example, switches, routers, access points and wireless LAN controllers are network devices. A laptop connected to a switch is a host, as is an IP phone connected to a wireless LAN controller.
A `host` can be discovered via **CDP/LLDP/IP** Device Tracking or **SNMP** Traps (only for wireless hosts).

The following picture shows the relation between a host and a network device.<br>

## What can we do with the host API ?

Just as the `/network-device` API can be used to retrieve device information, the `/host` API can be used to get detailed information about hosts in Inventory. For example, you can use the host API to get the name of a host, the ID of the VLAN that the host uses, the IP address of the host, the MAC address of the host, the IP address of the network device to which host is connected, and more.

### How to create a list of host IP addresses using the "GET /host" API
The `GET /host` response body contains the host name, type, IP and other information of each host. We can build a list of host IP addresses by parsing the response data and extracting the value of the "hostIp" attribute of each device that is represented in the response body. This is similar to what we did in Part I to parse the response from the `GET /network-device` request.

[APIC-EM API Reference Docs](http://devnetapic.cisco.com/) 

### Code -- GET '/host' ###

This code snippet gets all hosts from the controller, then parses the raw response to create a list of all host IP addresses. The raw response contains a block for each host; in each of these blocks, the "hostIp" attribute holds the IP address of a particular host.

*  Source code file: lab1-1-get-host.py
*  To run the python file, execute one of the following commands:<br>
				**Linux** or **Mac OS:**  `python3 lab1-1-get-host.py`<br>
				**Windows:** `py -3 lab1-1-get-host.py` or `python lab1-1-get-host.py`

**Code listing - lab1-1-get-host.py**

```python
"""
Script name: lab1-1-get-host.py
This script prints out all hosts that are connected to APIC-EM network devices in a tabular list format.
"""

from apicem import * 

def get_host():
    """
    This function returns a tabular list of all hosts that are connected to APIC-EM network devices.  
    Return:
    ------

    """
    host_list=[]
    try:
        resp = get(api="host") # The get() function is the simplify version for "get" function in requests module, defined in apicem.py
        response_json = resp.json() # Get the json-encoded content from response
        print ("Status: ",resp.status_code)  # This is the http request status
        # print (json.dumps(response_json,indent=4)) # Convert "response_json" object to a JSON formatted string and print it out    
    except:
        print ("Something wrong with GET /host request!")
        return host_list
    # Now create a list of host summary
    i=0
    for item in response_json["response"]:
        i+=1
        host_list.append([i,item["hostIp"],item["hostType"],item["connectedNetworkDeviceIpAddress"]])
    return host_list

if __name__ == "__main__": # Execute only if run as a script
    host=get_host()
    # We use tabulate module here to print a nice table format. You should use "pip" tool to install in your local machine
    # The tabulate module is imported in apicem.py
    # For the simplicity we just copy the source code in working directory without installing it
    print (tabulate(host,headers=['number','host IP','type','connected to network device'],tablefmt="rst"))
```

### Output

```

## Session summary ##
* The `host` API works similarly to the `network-device` API. You can use the host API to find out how many hosts are in Inventory, how each host connects to the network, and much more.  <br>
* 
In the next lab session, we will apply what we learned in this session  putting it all together to work with a new API, the `/flow-analysis` API.

## What's next?

* **Lab 2: Path Trace - Flow Analysis APIs**
